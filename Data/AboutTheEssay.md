# AboutTheAssignment
## User Agent
I am Matyáš Levínský who is just a master student of Sociology, writing an essay for a seminar called "Sociology of Science and Technology". I want to write with concise academic language, using as many information from my sources as possible. I do not want to know general information, and want to maximally avoid repeating myself, if I have the need to restate something I will refer to the previous passage. 

## Requirements
1. Academic language
2. 2500 to 4000 words
3. Use at least 5 academic sources 

## Concept
I would like to focus on the perception of AI in the public sphere, after all, it is not the fist time we are being told that AI will be taking away our jobs etc. The research question is basically: *What traits of AI hype are there in common between past AI booms and the present one; and are there sociological aspects to them?*

### Nice to haves
